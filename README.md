#Overview:
This project is a blockchain-based ticketing system that allows users to create and purchase event tickets securely and transparently. The system ensures that ticket transactions are recorded on the blockchain, preventing fraud and ensuring the integrity of the tickets.

#Features:
1)User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the platform.
2)Event Creation: Event organizers can create events. Upon event creation, a gas fee is deducted.
3)Ticket Listing: Created event tickets are listed on the homepage, available for purchase by other users.
4)Ticket Purchase: Users can purchase tickets, with the ticket price and gas fee being deducted from their account.
5)NFT Ticket: Purchased tickets are represented as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and can be viewed in the user's account.
6)QR Code Generation: Each NFT ticket comes with a unique QR code that can be used to enter the event.
7)Ticket Verification and Burning: At the event, the ticket holder's QR code is scanned. The corresponding NFT ticket is then burned, rendering the QR code unusable for future entries.
